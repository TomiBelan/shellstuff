# ----- SHELL OPTIONS ----------------------------------------------------------

# Bash won't get SIGWINCH if another process is in the foreground.
# Enable checkwinsize so that bash will check the terminal size when
# it regains control.
# Updated links:
#   https://bugs.gentoo.org/65623
#   https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/FAQ (E11)
shopt -s checkwinsize

# histappend is almost always meaningless, but we might as well enable it.
# Everyone online is wrong about it, except these links:
#   https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/428208
#   https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2016-05/msg00022.html
# histappend only matters when (num commands entered this session) > $HISTSIZE && $HISTFILESIZE > $HISTSIZE.
#   suppose HISTSIZE=5, HISTFILESIZE=100, and you run 10 commands and log out:
#   if histappend is off, HISTFILE will contain only the last 5 commands from this session.
#   if histappend is on, HISTFILE will contain 95 old commands and the last 5 commands from this session.
shopt -s histappend

# Obvious improvement, ought to be enabled by default.
shopt -s checkhash

# Disable history substitution with `!`. I don't think I ever used it on purpose.

# Show colors in tab completion.

# `exit 0` because:
# My current terminal (Wezterm) complains when bash has nonzero exit status.
# This forces bash to always exit with 0, even if the last command was "false"
# or we pressed ^C just before ^D. I'm OK with this because the exit status of
# an interactive shell isn't really meaningful.
#
# tmpfile stuff because:
# Clean up the temporary file used by our DEBUG trap below.
